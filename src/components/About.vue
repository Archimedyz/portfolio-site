        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Awais, a backend developer located in beautiful Montreal, Canada.</p>
        <p>I thrive on creating the behind-the-scenes magic that powers applications. My core expertise lies in C#, .NET Core, MS SQL, and Git. I'm passionate about writing efficient code and improving application performance. Although backend is my primary domain, I'm not afraid to venture into the frontend world (as you can see from this portfolio!).</p>
        <p>I am always open for collaboration and am eager to work with fellow developers on a variety of projects, including open-source initiatives and even small indie game development.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy unwinding with chess, manga, and podcasts.</p>
        <p>If you're looking for a collaborative backend developer with a focus on performance, let's connect!</p>
