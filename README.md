# Portfolio Site

Welcome to my portfolio site!

This site is a work in progress. Likely it'll remain that way forever, because when will I _really_ ever be done ðŸ¤”

If you like what you see, feel free to fork it and use it. All the info is hardcoded, but one day I'll setup a neat little backend for it.

## Running & Building

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before running any of the commands below, you should make sure you install all the node modules. You can do this by running:
>
> ```bash
> # using npm
> npm install
> 
> # using yarn
> yarn
> ```

---

To run the site locally, just use the `dev` command in the root directory of the repo:

```bash
# using npm
npm run dev

# using yarn
yarn dev
```

You can build the site as well using the `build` command:

```bash
# using npm
npm run build

# using yarn
yarn build
```

This will create a `dist/` directory with the built files for the site. It should include the `index.html`, any public assets such as favicons and manifests, and an `assets/` directory with all other assets and the main CSS and JS files.

After building, if you want to do a quick smoke test, you can preview your build using `preview`:

```bash
# using npm
npm run preview

# using yarn
yarn preview
```

## Contributing

For the time being, I am not looking for contributors for this repo/site. It's really just a solo project for me to learn the ropes of frontend development, and have fun.

If you find something that really bothers you, you can report it as an issue an I'll take a look. Thanks in advance!
